# Scania-failure-model
Machine learning project focused on predicting Scania APS system failures using publicly available sensor data. Includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training and evaluation for predictive maintenance.

QUICK INFO (this is NOT a final README file - it lacks detailed descriptions and doesn't follow professional standards):

- Preprocessed data was too big to be commited to github. Run **preprocessing.ipynb** to generate CSV datasets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test). Preprocessing.ipynb implements methods from preprocess.py, feature_engineering.py.
